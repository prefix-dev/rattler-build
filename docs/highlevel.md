# What is rattler-build?

`rattler-build` is a tool to build and package software so that it can be
installed on any operating system â€“ with any compatible package manager such as
`mamba`, `conda`, or `rattler`. We are also intending for rattler build to be
used as a library to drive builds of packages from any other recipe format in
the future.

### How does rattler-build work?

Building of packages consists of several steps. It all begins with a
`recipe.yaml` file that specifies how the package is to be built and what the
dependencies are. From the recipe file, `rattler-build` executes several steps:

1. Parse the recipe file and evaluate conditional parts (we will see that later,
   but parts of the recipe can be conditional e.g. on Windows vs. macOS)
2. Retrieve all source files specified in the recipe, such as `.tar.gz` files,
   `git` repositories or even local paths. Additionally, this step will apply
   patches that can be specified alongside the source file.
3. Download and install dependencies into temporary "host" and "build"
   workspaces. Any dependencies that are needed at build time are installed in
   this step.
4. Execute the build script to build/compile the source code, and "install" it
   into the host environment.
5. Collect _all_ files that are new in the "host" environment (because the build
   script just created them) and apply some transformations if necessary
   (specifically we edit the rpath on Linux and macOS to help make binaries
   relocatable).
6. Bundle all the files in a package and write out any additional metadata into
   the `info/index.json`, `info/about.json` and `info/paths.json` files. This
   also creates the test files that are bundled with the package.
7. If any tests are specified in the recipe, then we run them. If the package
   passes all the tests, it's considered done, otherwise we move it to a
   "broken" place.

After this process, a package is created. This package can be uploaded e.g. to a
custom [prefix.dev](https://prefix.dev) private or public channel.

### How to run rattler-build

Running rattler-build is straight-forward, just execute (on the command line):

```sh
rattler-build --recipe-file myrecipe/recipe.yaml
```

Or add a custom channel that is not conda-forge which is the default one.

```sh
rattler-build -c robostack --recipe-file myrecipe/recipe.yaml
```

### Overview of a recipe.yaml

A recipe.yaml file is separated into multiple sections and can conditionally
include or exclude sections. Recipe files also support a limited amount of
string interpolation with `Jinja` (`minijinja` in our case).

A simple example for the `zlib` package would look as follows:

```yaml title="recipe.yaml"
# variables from the context section can be used in the rest of the recipe
# in jinja expressions
context:
  version: 1.2.13

package:
  name: zlib
  version: ${{ version }}

source:
  url: http://zlib.net/zlib-${{ version }}.tar.gz
  sha256: b3a24de97a8fdbc835b9833169501030b8977031bcb54b3b3ac13740f846ab30

build:
  # build numbers can be set arbitrarily
  number: 0
  script:
    # build script to install the package into the $PREFIX (host prefix)
    - if: unix
      then:
      - ./configure --prefix=$PREFIX
      - make -j$CPU_COUNT
    - if: win
      then:
      - cmake -G "Ninja" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=%LIBRARY_PREFIX%
      - ninja install

requirements:
  build:
    # compiler is a special function.
    - ${{ compiler("c") }}
    # The following two dependencies are only needed on Windows,
    # and thus conditionally selected
    - if: win
      then:
        - cmake
        - ninja
    - if: unix
      then:
        - make
```

The sections of a recipe are:

| sections       | description                                                                                                                                                     |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `context`      | in this section you can define variables that can be used in the Jinja context later in the recipe (e.g. name and version are commonly interpolated in strings) |
| `package`      | this section defines the name and version of the package you are currently building and will be the name of the final output                                    |
| `source`       | defines from where the source code is going to be downloaded from and checksums                                                                                 |
| `build`        | the settings for the build and the build script                                                                                                                 |
| `requirements` | allows the definition of build, host, run and run-constrained dependencies.                                                                                     |
