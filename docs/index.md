# `rattler-build`: A Fast Conda Package Builder

The `rattler-build` tooling and library creates cross-platform relocatable
binaries / packages from a simple recipe format. The recipe format is heavily
inspired by `conda-build` and `boa`, and the output of a regular `rattler-build`
run is a package that can be installed using `mamba`, `rattler` or `conda`.

`rattler-build` does not have any dependencies on `conda-build` or Python and
works as a standalone binary.

### Installation

The recommended way of installing `rattler-build`, being a conda-package builder, is through a conda package manager.
Next to `rattler-build` we are also building [`pixi`](https://pixi.sh).

With `pixi` you can install `rattler-build` globally:

```bash
pixi global install rattler-build
```

Other options are:
=== "Conda"
    ```shell
    conda install rattler-build -c conda-forge

    mamba install rattler-build -c conda-forge
    micromamba install rattler-build -c conda-forge

    pixi global install rattler-build
    pixi add rattler-build # To a pixi project
    ```

=== "Homebrew"
    ```shell
    brew install rattler-build
    ```
=== "Arch Linux"
    ```shell
    pacman -S rattler-build
    ```
=== "Binary"
    ```shell
    # Download the latest release from the GitHub releases page, for example the linux x86 version with curl:
    curl -SL --progress-bar https://github.com/prefix-dev/rattler-build/releases/latest/download/rattler-build-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
    ```
    You can grab version of `rattler-build` from the [Github
    Releases](https://github.com/prefix-dev/rattler-build/releases/).

### Completion

When installing `rattler-build` you might want to enable shell completion.
Afterwards, restart the shell or source the shell config file.

### Bash (default on most Linux systems)

```bash
echo 'eval "$(rattler-build completion --shell bash)"' >> ~/.bashrc
```
### Zsh (default on macOS)

```zsh
echo 'eval "$(rattler-build completion --shell zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

### PowerShell (pre-installed on all Windows systems)

```pwsh
Add-Content -Path $PROFILE -Value '(& rattler-build completion --shell powershell) | Out-String | Invoke-Expression'
```

!!! tip "Failure because no profile file exists"
    Make sure your profile file exists, otherwise create it with:
    ```PowerShell
    New-Item -Path $PROFILE -ItemType File -Force
    ```


### Fish

```fish
echo 'rattler-build completion --shell fish | source' >> ~/.config/fish/config.fish
```

### Nushell

Add the following to the end of your Nushell env file (find it by running `$nu.env-path` in Nushell):

```nushell
mkdir ~/.cache/rattler-build
rattler-build completion --shell nushell | save -f ~/.cache/rattler-build/completions.nu
```

And add the following to the end of your Nushell configuration (find it by running `$nu.config-path`):

```nushell
use ~/.cache/rattler-build/completions.nu *
```

### Elvish

```elv
echo 'eval (rattler-build completion --shell elvish | slurp)' >> ~/.elvish/rc.elv
```

### Dependencies

Currently `rattler-build` needs some dependencies on the host system which are
executed as subprocess. We plan to reduce the number of external dependencies
over time by writing what we need in Rust to make `rattler-build` fully
self-contained.

* `tar` to unpack tarballs downloaded from the internet in a variety of formats.
  `.gz`, `.bz2` and `.xz` are widely used and one might have to install the
  compression packages as well (e.g. `gzip`, `bzip2`, ...)
* `patch` to patch source code after downloading
* `install_name_tool` is necessary on macOS to rewrite the `rpath` of shared
  libraries and executables to make it relative
* `patchelf` is required on Linux to rewrite the `rpath` and `runpath` of shared
  libraries and executables
* `git` to checkout Git repositories (not implemented yet, but will require `git`
  in the future)
* `msvc` on Windows because we cannot ship the MSVC compiler on conda-forge
  (needs to be installed on the host machine)

On Windows, to obtain these dependencies from conda-forge, one can install
`m2-patch`, `m2-bzip2`, `m2-gzip`, `m2-tar`.


### GitHub Action

There is a GitHub Action for `rattler-build`. It can be used to install `rattler-build` in CI/CD workflows and run a build command. Please check out the [GitHub Action documentation](https://github.com/prefix-dev/rattler-build-action) for more information.

    --disable-static --enable-shared

make -j${CPU_COUNT} ${VERBOSE_AT}
make install

# Includes man pages and other miscellaneous.
rm -rf "${PREFIX}/share"
```

**`build.bat`**

```cmd
mkdir build
