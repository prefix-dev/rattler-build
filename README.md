# rattler-build: a fast conda-package builder

The `rattler-build` tooling and library creates cross-platform relocatable
binaries / packages from a simple recipe format. The recipe format is heavily
inspired by `conda-build` and `boa`, and the output of a regular `rattler-build`
run is a package that can be installed using `mamba`, `rattler` or `conda`.

`rattler-build` does not have any dependencies on `conda-build` or `Python` and
works as a standalone binary.

### Installation

You can grab a prerelease version of `rattler-build` from the [Github
Releases](https://github.com/prefix-dev/rattler-build/releases/).

#### Dependencies

Currently `rattler-build` needs some dependencies on the host system which are
executed as subprocess. We plan to reduce the number of external dependencies
over time by writing what we need in Rust to make `rattler-build` fully
self-contained.

* `tar` to unpack tarballs downloaded from the internet in a variety of formats.
  `.gz`, `.bz2` and `.xz` are widely used and one might have to install the
  compression packages as well (e.g. `gzip`, `bzip2`, ...)
* `patch` to patch source code after downloading
* `install_name_tool` is necessary on macOS to rewrite the `rpath` of shared
  libraries and executables to make it relative
* `patchelf` is required on Linux to rewrite the `rpath` and `runpath` of shared
  libraries and executables
* `git` to checkout Git repositories (not implemented yet, but will require git
  in the future)
* `msvc` on Windows because we cannot ship the MSVC compiler on conda-forge
  (needs to be installed on the host machine)

On Windows, to obtain these dependencies from conda-forge, one can install
`m2-patch`, `m2-bzip2`, `m2-gzip`, `m2-tar`.

### Documentation

We have extensive documentation for `rattler-build`. You can find the [book
here](https://prefix-dev.github.io/rattler-build).

### Usage

`rattler-build` comes with two commands: `build` and `test`.

The `build` command takes a `--recipe recipe.yaml` as input and produces a
package as output. The `test` subcommand can be used to test existing packages
(tests are shipped with the package).

### The recipe format

> **Note** You can find all examples below in the [`examples`](./examples/)
> folder and run them with `rattler-build`.

A simple example recipe for the `xtensor` header-only C++ library:

For this recipe, two additional script files (`build.sh` and `build.bat`) are
needed.

**build.sh**

```bash

make -j${CPU_COUNT} ${VERBOSE_AT}
make install

# Includes man pages and other miscellaneous.
rm -rf "${PREFIX}/share"
