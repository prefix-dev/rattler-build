    Build packages from a list of recipes.

    Args:
        recipes: The recipe files or directories containing `recipe.yaml`.
        up_to: Build recipes up to the specified package.
        build_platform: The build platform to use for the build (e.g. for building with emulation, or rendering).
        target_platform: The target platform for the build.
        host_platform: The host platform for the build. If set, it will be used to determine also the target_platform (as long as it is not noarch).
        channel: Add a channel to search for dependencies in.
        variant_config: Variant configuration files for the build.
        ignore_recipe_variants: Do not read the `variants.yaml` file next to a recipe.
        render_only: Render the recipe files without executing the build.
        with_solve: Render the recipe files with solving dependencies.
        keep_build: Keep intermediate build artifacts after the build.
        no_build_id: Don't use build id(timestamp) when creating build directory name.
        package_format: The package format to use for the build. Can be one of `tar-bz2` or `conda`. You can also add a compression level to the package format, e.g. `tar-bz2:<number>` (from 1 to 9) or `conda:<number>` (from -7 to 22).
        compression_threads: The number of threads to use for compression (only relevant when also using `--package-format conda`).
        io_concurrency_limit: The maximum number of concurrent I/O operations. This is useful for limiting the number of concurrent file operations.
        no_include_recipe: Don't store the recipe in the final package.
        test: The strategy to use for running tests.
        output_dir: The directory to store the output.
        auth_file: The authentication file.
        channel_priority: The channel priority.
        skip_existing: Whether to skip packages that already exist in any channel. If set to `none`, do not skip any packages, default when not specified. If set to `local`, only skip packages that already exist locally, default when using `--skip-existing`. If set to `all`, skip packages that already exist in any channel.
        noarch_build_platform: Define a "noarch platform" for which the noarch packages will be built for. The noarch builds will be skipped on the other platforms.
        allow_insecure_host: Allow insecure hosts for the build.
        continue_on_failure: Continue building other recipes even if one fails.
