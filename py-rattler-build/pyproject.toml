# We exclude the rattler module from warn_return_any, because the PyO3 api does not have Python
# type annotations. See https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3/issues/1112 for a discussion on adding
# this capability. We could add a stub file for rattler_build.rattler_build (the PyO3 api), but that
# amounts to duplicating almost all type annotations on our api, as the Python api itself is a
# thin wrapper around the PyO3 api to start with.
